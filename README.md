```
```
Install IIS. Follow this link to have three ways to install it:
```

```
In IIS: 
```
```
Create Site: Name: ItemsMSystem, Application pool: ItemsMSystem, Physical path: C:\Items Management System, Binding Type: http, Binding Port: 8081
```
```
Run the following link to access to the application:
